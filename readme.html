    <p>Every summer, South Korea experiences significant property and human life damages due to typhoons. Accurate typhoon track prediction, which entails precise forecasting of the path and intensity of a typhoon during its development phase, is paramount. Such predictions provide relevant institutions and residents with the time needed for pre-emptive measures and responses, thus preventing potential damages in advance.</p>

    <p>Our project targets this issue by constructing a typhoon track prediction using <a href="https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/modulus/modulus-sym/user_guide/neural_operators/fourcastnet.html"><span style="color:#2980b9"><strong>FourCastNet(FCN)</strong></span></a>, a weather forecasting model based on the Fourier Neural Operator (FNO).</p>

    <p>In our project, we focused on studying the integration of FCN, which was trained on ERA5 data, <strong>with the JMA Best Track data</strong>. This effort aims to harness the robust predictive power of FCN and the highly accurate historical records of the JMA to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of our weather forecasting model.</p>

    <p>For instance, the HINNAMNOR typhoon that hit Korea from August to September in 2022 underscores the necessity of such systems. If we could have accurately predicted the path of Typhoon HINNAMNOR in advance, more effective responses could have been made to reduce the damages.</p>

    <p>If you&#39;re interested in understanding what typhoons are, how they form, and how we can predict their path, explore our website. It provides not only basic information about typhoons and weather forecasting but also details on how our FourCastNet model operates. This information will help raise your understanding of typhoons and increase awareness of how we can protect ourselves from these natural disasters.</p>
